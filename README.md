# Learn Kotlin Micronaut Kafka

This project demonstrates the integration of Micronaut with Kafka using Kotlin. It showcases how to set up a Kafka producer and consumer within a Micronaut application, leveraging Avro for message serialization.

## Key Features

- **Micronaut Framework**: Utilizes Micronaut for building a lightweight and efficient microservice.
- **Kafka Integration**: Implements a Kafka producer and consumer to handle message streaming.
- **Avro Serialization**: Uses Avro schemas for efficient and compact serialization of messages.
- **In-Memory Repository**: Stores and retrieves data using an in-memory repository for demonstration purposes.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Demonstrates the use of scheduled tasks to produce messages at regular intervals.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Kafka and a Schema Registry running locally.
2. **Build and Run**: Use Gradle to build the project and run the application.
3. **Observe**: Check the logs to see the producer sending messages and the consumer processing them.

This example is ideal for learning how to integrate Kafka with Micronaut and handle real-time data processing in a Kotlin application.
